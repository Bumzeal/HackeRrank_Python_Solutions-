## TASK

Given an integer n, perform the following conditional actions:

* If n is odd, print Weird
* If n is even and n in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
* If n is even and n in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
* If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

### SOLUTION

## Task 2
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b . Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

## Task 3

The provided code stub reads and integer,n, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n :print(i**2).

Example
n = 3
The list of non-negative integers that are less than n= 3 is [0,1,2]
